Well, I am writing to help me code further in this project. Basically I wanted a project as all-in-one thing for creating 
and developing with Yii. So I wanted the following:

1. Site : 
        - Create a new site in an empty directory - so check if directory is empty or directory does not exist then create a
          entire directory structure may be I should copy code from console 
        - Import an existing site..means a models, its functions and controllers and its functions

-------- For both these things TO DO: A form and then corresponding action in the controller

2. Models :
         create a model from a schema definition 
                - should we allow people to define schema? I think so-- we should It makes sense not to deal with the database
                  directly - so a form to add an attribute and he can see all the attributes
                - write three or four functions which would expose data of the model useful for AJAX functions - like in list
                  format useful for drop downs
                - make some changes in the function from the project itself.. 
                   - write a regex to extract function name from the code of the function so that in case function name is
                     changed we can change function name also.. then write a code to open the code file and make necessary
                     changes in those lines in the code
                - Add a model function 
                - Add an attribute and then change corresponding model file 
3. Controllers
                 - create a controller 
                 - add controller function and merge with the code file 
4. Views
                 - In the parameters - add documentation option so that we know what are parameters
                 - elements input drop down, add event options for elements , elements which can be populated using ajax
                 - nav bars, side nav bars , elements with nice looking headings
                 - create a view....view elements with id , ability to use these elements with in other views-- a challenge

                 - Paradigm of drag and insert---we shall stick to that - add ability to change class of the element.. 
                   easy to add

5. Documentation for the project

-- Alpha release we would not add Models and controllers part...and only concentrate on views.....so whatever is left of 
   views you should do
